# MOAT
A simple tool to semi-automate the responses in the tedious Office Activation calls.

## What is MOAT?
MOAT is a simple tool that will give answers to the questions given to you by the Microsoft Activation Call Center. It will lead the call to the Activation Website using automated responses. This makes it much less tedious to sit in a call with a Microsoft robot for 2 minutes, giving the same answers again and again.

This tool normally is not useful for the average consumer, and tends to be more useful for people that do need to activate Office a lot of times by phone, think of PC refurbishing or other IT companies.

## How to use MOAT

### Requirements
- An Android Phone with USB debugging enabled
- A USB cable to plug said phone into your computer

### How to Prepare Your Phone for Use with MOAT

To automate the Microsoft Office activation process with MOAT, you'll need to enable **USB Debugging** on your phone. USB Debugging allows MOAT to interact with your phone using **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**. Follow this step-by-step guide to prepare your Android device.

#### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode on Your Phone
To access the **USB Debugging** option, you'll first need to enable **Developer Mode** on your phone.

> [!CAUTION]
> Incorrect use of the USB debugging feature, or the incorrect use of the Developer Mode, can cause security risks or potential damage to your phone. Make sure to disable Developer Mode once you are finished using MOAT.

1. **Open the Settings app** on your phone.
2. **Scroll down and select "About phone"** (or "About device").
3. **Find "Build Number"** (it might be under "Software Information").
4. **Tap "Build Number" seven times** quickly. You may need to enter your phone's PIN or password if prompted.
5. Youâ€™ll see a message saying "**You are now a developer!**" or "**Developer mode has been enabled.**"

#### Step 2: Enable USB Debugging
Once Developer Mode is enabled, follow these steps to turn on USB Debugging:

1. **Go back to the Settings app** and scroll down to find **"Developer Options."**
   - This is usually under **System** or **Additional Settings** on some devices.
2. **Open Developer Options.**
3. Scroll down and **find the "USB Debugging" option**.
4. **Toggle USB Debugging ON.**
5. Confirm by pressing **OK** on the dialog box that appears.

#### Step 3: Connect Your Phone to Your Computer
1. Use a **USB cable** to connect your phone to the computer where MOAT is installed (you can run MOAT from a USB stick if needed).
2. A prompt will appear on your phone asking, "**Allow USB Debugging?**"
3. Check the box for **"Always allow from this computer"** and press **OK** to confirm.


#### Troubleshooting
- **No Device Detected**: If your device doesn't show up, ensure that:
  - USB Debugging is enabled.
  - The correct USB connection mode is selected (some phones need to be in **File Transfer (MTP)** mode).
  - Your USB cable is working and supports data transfer (not just charging).

- **Unauthorized Device**: If your device shows as **unauthorized**, disconnect and reconnect your phone. You may need to re-allow USB Debugging from the computer.
